# 📘 NLP  — Natural Language Processing Tutorials & Examples

Welcome to the **NLP** repository — a collection of interactive notebooks that demonstrate key concepts, techniques, and workflows in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using Python. This repository is designed as a learning resource for anyone interested in understanding NLP from fundamentals to practical implementation.

## 🧠 About

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Using tools like tokenizers, models, and linguistic processing libraries, NLP bridges the gap between human communication and machine understanding.

This repository includes examples of common NLP tasks such as text preprocessing, tokenization, POS tagging, named entity recognition, and vectorization techniques like Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF.
